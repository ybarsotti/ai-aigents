# ðŸ¤– AI & AI Agents Playground

This repository is a personal sandbox for experimenting with various AI techniques and tools. The focus is on hands-on exploration of topics such as:

- Prompt Engineering
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Low-code automation using tools like LangChain, N8N, etc.

All tests and prototypes will be documented step-by-step using Jupyter notebooks for clarity.

Additionally, I'm building a custom RAG solution using my own content, which I plan to integrate into my personal website. Letâ€™s see how it goes!

# ðŸš€ Getting Started
